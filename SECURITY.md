# Security

If you find a vulnerability in one of our projects maintained by Moss Piglet,
please report that directly to the project maintaining that code.

If you've been unable to find a way to report it,
or have received no response after repeated attempts, please contact 
Moss Piglet directly at our security contact email, security @ mosspiglet . dev.

Please keep in mind that we are a small team.

Thank you.
